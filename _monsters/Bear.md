description: "Watch out - after blocking on the first turn, this guy hits - HARD!"
flavor: "Barbearians believe the only meaning in life comes from asserting their strength and backrubs on a nice tree. Since their Nuka-mutation, they no longer need to hibernate â€“ they just require frequent naps instead."

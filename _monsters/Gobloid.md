name: "Gobloid"
description: "This enemy is quick - watch out for his blitz attacks!"
flavor: "Filthy, but not quite as stupid as they look, Gobloids are fearful of outsiders due to a history of being bullied. They band together in the hope of establishing a new land, one stinky enough to ensure they're left alone by the outside world."

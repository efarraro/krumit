name: "Jackal"
description: "This enemy starts with stealth, preventing you from targeting it until you attack in battle"
flavor: "Jackals are adept at running long distances, which is helpful given theyâ€™re total cowards. They work in groups and will often complete large jigsaw puzzles together, when not trying to ambush someone."

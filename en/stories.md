## The Bravura Bard

Bruno trudged through the fetid marshes of the Slithering Swamps, muttering to himself the while.

> I’ll show that jumped up twit at Barding & Scribe Monthly what’s what - inauthentic? Hopelessly naive romanticisation of the brutal nature of the world? Childishly frivolous similies? My next submission will pierce his cynicism like a valiant sword thrust through the still-beating heart of a… of a…

> Of a giant serpent, yes, that’ll do -- 

Bruno stopped muttering. The ground beneath him was slithering. It shouldn’t have been doing that. A few metres away, there was a shiny green hill that hadn’t been there for a minute ago - and where was such a loud hissing coming from? 

> If I wasn’t mistaken, I’d say I’d chanced upon the Great Slitherer! Of course - such a thing is only an invention of bards and storytellers such as I…

Bruno decided to begin running, fast, in the direction of the Screaming Hills and their yawning caverns, just in case. He reached the foothills and made for a small cave, his breath coming in ragged gasps, and he looked behind him. There was a bloody great snake hurtling at him, mouth agape displaying fangs like battle-lines of cruel spears. The cave was so near - so inviting in its cool, dark safety - but would that really make for a poem of a kind that Editor Erglebod Blowski wouldn’t call ‘bloated with self-pomposity and less soul-nourishing value than a tankard of toilet-water?’ No...he would stand, and show this serendipitous serpent why he called himself Bombastic Bruno The Bravura Bard. So he stood, and yelled his fiercest battle-cry. The snake, not a jot impressed, swallowed him whole.

And then regurgitated him, finding the pointy bits on his helmet and the coarseness of his bushy beard highly irritating to its throat. Bruno was expelled from the serpent’s maw with force enough to send him hurtling into the small cave he’d so nearly - and wisely! - considered cowering in. There Bruno sat, snake saliva running down his face, and there he composed the first of his now-legendary epic Adventure Haiku compendiums: 

> The Great Slitherer! 

> I saw its heart of darkness

> But emerged a-new! 

Bruno wiped a few drops of snake juice into a stoppered bottle for proof, and considered the next destination on his journey. 

> Oh Erglebod. You aint seen nothing yet.
